# 8-bit-Simple-Processor
The 8-Bit Simple Processor is a Verilog HDL–based project designed for educational and experimental purposes. It demonstrates the basic architecture and working of a simple processor that can execute arithmetic, logic, and memory operations using an 8-bit data path.

The processor follows a RISC-like architecture, consisting of key components such as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, Program Counter (PC), Instruction Decoder, and Memory Unit. It operates on a fetch–decode–execute cycle, providing a clear understanding of how instructions are processed within a CPU.
